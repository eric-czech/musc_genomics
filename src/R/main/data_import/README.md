Should all navitoclax experiments be used or only ones where compound name is precisely navitoclax?

Others:

      Navitoclax variants
      [343] "navitoclax"                               "navitoclax:birinapant (1:1 mol/mol)"     
      [345] "navitoclax:gemcitabine (1:1 mol/mol)"     "navitoclax:MST-312 (1:1 mol/mol)"        
      [347] "navitoclax:piperlongumine (1:1 mol/mol)"  "navitoclax:pluripotin (1:1 mol/mol)"     
      [349] "navitoclax:PLX-4032 (1:1 mol/mol)"        "navitoclax:sorafenib (1:1 mol/mol)" 
      

It appears that some of the sensitivity experiments are truly conducted multiple times for the same cell lines (mean will be used).  See ```ctd2_duplicated_cell_lines.png``` for all such cell lines and their corresponding AUC values across experiments
